# Ride-allocation-System
This is a real-time Ride Allocation System that simulates assigning available drivers to passengers requesting rides, with visual feedback through a clean and interactive web interface. Itâ€™s built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) on the backend and Vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS on the frontend.
